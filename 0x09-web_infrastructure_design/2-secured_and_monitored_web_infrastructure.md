This is a 3-server web infrastructure that is secured, monitored, and serves encrypted traffic.

Specifics About This Infrastructure
The purpose of the firewalls.
The firewalls are for protecting the network (web servers, anyway) from unwanted and unauthorized users by acting as an intermediary between the internal network and the external network and blocking the incoming traffic matching the aforementioned criteria.
The purpose of the SSL certificate.
The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and network sniffers from sniffing the traffic which could expose valuable information. The SSL certs ensure privacy, integrity, and identification.
